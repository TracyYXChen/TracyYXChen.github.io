## what am I doing now
I’m a computer science Ph.D. student working on human-AI interaction [at the University of Maryland](https://hcil.umd.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I developed AI-assisted tools for creators/analysts (some projects collaborated with Adobe). 

## before coming to the U.S.
I come from [Neijiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neijiang){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a city on the bank of a tributary of the Yangtze River in Sichuan Province, China. If you've read [River Town by Peter Hessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Town:_Two_Years_on_the_Yangtze){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, my life is like a sequel to the book: my mom attended a teachers' college and later became an English teacher. I received my B.S. from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in [Hefei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hefei){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Anhui Province, which I consider as my second hometown.


## tennis
When I am not doing research, I am usually playing tennis. I was on the varsity team when I was an undergrad. I currently play in the USTA league as an [NTRP 3.5 player](https://www.usta.com/content/dam/usta/pdfs/10013_experience_player_ntrp_guidelines.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I always travel with my racket, and here is [a map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1GRiYfEKGLojztDRf_SbnKBUKRliBxOM&hl=en&usp=sharing) of the tennis courts I’ve visited on the earth.


## future plan
I plan to either join a startup or start my own company. The following books have changed the weights and bias of my mental models. If you're looking for a co-founder and also have read some of the books, feel free to contact me.

### 我在做什么
我叫陈玥西，简称Tracy，目前在美国马里兰大学计算机系读博士，方向是[人机交互](https://hcil.umd.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}。我开发给创作者和数据分析师使用的新型工具（和Adobe公司有一些合作）。

### 从前
我来自内江，一座四川中南部的小城市，有一条长江的支流穿城而过。如果你读过[彼得海斯勒的《江城》](https://m.douban.com/book/subject/7060185/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}，那么我的人生仿佛是它的续集：像那些涪陵师范的学生一样，我妈妈师范毕业后也成为了一名英语老师。我本科毕业于中国科学技术大学（1314），因此我也认为合肥是我的第二故乡。


### 网球
当我不写代码的时候，我往往在打网球。像许多中国小朋友一样，我从小打乒乓球，不过我上大学之后改练网球，后来加入了校队，曾经代表科大参加大学生网球比赛（甲组，非特长生）。我目前作为NTRP3.5选手参加美国网球协会的业余联赛。我有一张[谷歌地图](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1GRiYfEKGLojztDRf_SbnKBUKRliBxOM&hl=en&usp=sharing){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}记录地球上我去过的网球场。

### 未来
我打算今后加入创业公司或者自己创业。以下[书籍](#books)改变了我大脑神经网络的权重和偏置，如果你正在寻找合作伙伴并且也读过其中一些，欢迎联系我。
