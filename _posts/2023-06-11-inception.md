### Passion for tennis
I played varsity tennis when I was an undergrad in China. Currently, I live in Maryland and actively play in USTA/UTR leagues in the DMV area. I’ve also traveled to tournaments like US Open and WTA finals. Here is [a map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1GRiYfEKGLojztDRf_SbnKBUKRliBxOM&hl=en&usp=sharing) of the tennis courts I’ve visited on the earth.

### Proficiency in data analysis:
As a computer science Ph.D. student, I am a trained data scientist.

### Players to analyze:
Carlos Alcaraz, Elena Rybakina, Iga Swiatek, and Chinese tennis players: Qinwen Zheng, Juncheng Shang, Yibing Wu, etc.
