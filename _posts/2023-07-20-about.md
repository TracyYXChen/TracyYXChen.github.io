## Motivation:
I use Medium to document my machine learning/data science projects/talks, however, sometimes I hit the paywall when reading other Medium articles (it only allows 3 free articles per month). The frustration motivates me to maintain an open-source version of my Medium blogs. 

Besides, though I'm a native Chinese speaker, I'm also worried that my Chinese writing deteriorates since I haven't written Chinese blogs for a long time, so I decide to practice writing in Chinese. To be honest, I can't write machine learning/data science in Chinese (I picked up computer science after I came to the US, so I don't know how to describe technical terms in Chinese), so I'll just write about non-technical stuff.

## Goal: 
- write a machine learning/data science blog **every two months** 
- write in Chinese **every three months** (avoid any English words as mental shortcuts)
- **total: 10 blogs every year** (blogs migrated from Medium does not count)
